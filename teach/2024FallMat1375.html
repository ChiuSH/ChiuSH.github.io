<br>

<b>Course Description:</b> MAT1375 is an introduction of functions and it is the foundation of Mathematics. 
		  Mathematicians study everything about the functions and use them to describe complicated phenomenon in nature.
		MAT1375 is the beginning of the function-study journey and topics include polynomial
functions, inverse functions, radical functions, rational functions,
trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions. 
		  Besides, we will introduce how to solve inequalities, 
how to solve trigonometric equations and identities involving sum, double and half-angle formulas,
		  and elements of vectors and complex numbers.
		  <br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> MAT 1275 or MAT 1275CO OR Meet the Math Placement for MAT 1375.<br>
<br>
<details>
   <summary>		  
<b>Evaluation:</b> Your final grade will be calculated as:<br>
Three in-class tests (50% total) + one in-class Final Exam (25%)+ in-class quizzes (15%)+ class attendance/participation (10%).
   </summary>
	<p><b>Three in-class tests (50%):</b><br>
There will be three exams. If you miss a test for a verifiable reason (for example, illness or family
emergency), you must notify me as soon as possible and provide a written verification from an appropriate 
authority (not a family member), otherwise you will score 0 for that test. 
Personal travel is not a valid excuse. Your lowest test grade will NOT be dropped, 
		but it will only count for 10% while the other two grades will count for a total of 40% of your final grade.
You are expected to take all tests. There will be <b>no make-up test</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing test will be counted as <b>zero</b>. <b>No extra time</b> will be given in tests to students who arrive late.
          <br><br>
    <b>One in-classFinal Exam (25%):</b><br>
The final exam will be a one-session exam based on the whole term. It will be given on the last day of
classes, Thursday, <b>December 19, 8:00 am - 9:40 am</b>. 
It is the responsibility of each student to be available at the time of the examination. 
You <b>must</b> take the final exam in order to pass the course.
		<br><br>
   <b>In-class quizzes (15%):</b><br>
      The quiz will be given in the first 10 - 15 mins of each lecture when it is not a test or exam day. 
		The grade will be evenly distributed over all the quizzes. 
		There will be <b>no make-up quiz</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing quiz will be counted as <b>zero</b>.
		<b>No extra time</b> will be given in quizzes to students who arrive late.
		<br><br>
  <b>Class attendance/participation (10%):</b><br>	
    	Class attendance/participation will count for 10% of the final grade. The purpose of these discussions
is to gain practice at analyzing problems and communicating effectively. 
		You will get a classwork sheet in each class and you will finish the sheet 
		and <b>turn in the sheet</b> to the instructor at the end of class.
