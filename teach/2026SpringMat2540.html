Welcome to the home page for Spring 2026, MAT2540: Discrete Structures and Algorithms II!<br>
<br>
<b>Instructor:</b> Prof. Shang-Huan Chiu<br>
<br>
<b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:shang-huan.chiu40@citytech.cuny.edu">shang-huan.chiu40[at]citytech[dot]cuny[dot]edu</a><br>
<br>
<b>Lecture Time:</b> 08:00 am - 09:40 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays<br> 
<br>
<b>Room:</b> Namm Hall N-420A<br>
<br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 10:00 am - 12:00pm on Tuesdays or by appointment<br>
<br>
<b>Textbook:</b> K.H. Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, 8th edition, McGraw Hill <br>
<br>
<b>Course Description:</b> MAT2540 is an introduction of Mathemactical Thinking and its applications. 
		  We will first introduce the foundation of the Mathemactical thinking: the elements and operators 
		  which are utilized to translate the real world idea into Mathematical concepts.
		  After the introduction, we will use the brain of Mathemactical thinking to study some basic topics.
		  Topics include functions, relations, sets, simple proof techniques, Boolean algebra, 
		  propositional logic, elementary number theory, writing, analyzing and testing algorithms.
		  <br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> MAT 2440.<br>
<br>
<details>
   <summary>		  
<b>Evaluation:</b> Your final grade will be calculated as:<br>
Three in-class tests (50% total) + one in-class Final Exam (25%)+ In-class quizzes (10%) and class participation (5%) + Homework (10%) + Optional Project (5%).
   </summary>
	<p><b>Three in-class tests (50%):</b><br>
There will be three exams. If you miss a test for a verifiable reason (for example, illness or family
emergency), you must notify me as soon as possible and provide a written verification from an appropriate 
authority (not a family member), otherwise you will score 0 for that test. 
Personal travel is not a valid excuse. Your lowest test grade will NOT be dropped, 
		but it will only count for 10% while the other two grades will count for a total of 40% of your final grade.
You are expected to take all tests. There will be <b>no make-up test</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing test will be counted as <b>zero</b>. <b>No extra time</b> will be given in tests to students who arrive late.
          <br><br>
    <b>One in-class Final Exam (25%):</b><br>
The final exam will be a one-session exam based on the whole term. It will be given on the last day of
classes, Tuesday, <b>May 26, 08:00 am - 09:40 am</b>. 
It is the responsibility of each student to be available at the time of the examination. 
You <b>must</b> take the final exam in order to pass the course.
		<br><br>
   <b>In-class quizzes (10%) and class participation (5%):</b><br>
      The quiz will be given in the first 10 - 15 mins weekly when it is not a test or exam day. 
		The grade will be evenly distributed over all the quizzes. 
		There will be <b>no make-up quiz</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing quiz will be counted as <b>zero</b>.
		<b>No extra time</b> will be given in quizzes to students who arrive late.
		Class participation includes class discussion and the classwork. 
		The purpose of these discussions is to gain practice at analyzing problems 
		and communicating effectively. 
		You will get a classwork sheet in each class and you will finish the sheet 
		in the class.
		<br><br>
  <b>Homework (10%):</b><br>
		Homework will be assigned once the corresponding section is finished. You will have 5 days to one week to finish it. 
    	        Only <b>one or two</b> selected questions will be graded. 
          <br><br>
<b>Optional Project (5%):</b><br>	
    	    A writing project will be assigned during the semester.
          <br>		
	</p>
</details><br>
<br>
<b>Homework: This course is designated as a Writing Intensive course</b> 
	• You can find the selected Homework question numbers and schedule on page 4 of 
	<a href="https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/mathematics/docs/courses/MAT2540.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
		Course Outline</a>. You may also have the
		<a  href="2026springDSA2/MAT2540_HWschedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">table of homework schedule</a> 
			  to track your progress. 
			  <br>
	• Finishing Homework questions will be helpful for you to answer the questions in quizzes/tests or class participation.
			  <br>
	• Each homework will be collected <b>in person</b> on the due date and submitting online or via email is <b>Not</b> acceptable. 
			  <br>
    • Each homework will be graded (1-2 selected questions) and returned to you in one week or so. The late homework is <b>Not</b> acceptable. 		   
<br>
<br>
<b>Attendance policy:</b> You are expected to attend all classes and are responsible for all the material covered. 
		  Attendance is required and will be taken during the class. 
		  Lateness and students leaving before the end of the class period will be recorded.
<br>
<br>
<b>Available help:</b>
• You are encouraged to come to my office hours for help.<br>
<!• If you have a question about a homework problem, I prefer you to post your question on the Discussion Board 
		  of brightspace (and leave the email for personal and individual questions). 
		  I will log into brightspace every day during the weekdays to check the Discussion Board 
		  and to moderate ongoing discussions.>
