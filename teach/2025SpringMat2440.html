   <summary>		  
<b>Evaluation:</b> Your final grade will be calculated as:<br>
Three in-class tests (50% total) + one in-class Final Exam (25%)+ In-class quizzes and class participation (10%) + Homework (10%) + Project (5%).
   </summary>
	<p><b>Three in-class tests (50%):</b><br>
There will be three exams. If you miss a test for a verifiable reason (for example, illness or family
emergency), you must notify me as soon as possible and provide a written verification from an appropriate 
authority (not a family member), otherwise you will score 0 for that test. 
Personal travel is not a valid excuse. Your lowest test grade will NOT be dropped, 
		but it will only count for 10% while the other two grades will count for a total of 40% of your final grade.
You are expected to take all tests. There will be <b>no make-up test</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing test will be counted as <b>zero</b>. <b>No extra time</b> will be given in tests to students who arrive late.
          <br><br>
    <b>One in-class Final Exam (25%):</b><br>
The final exam will be a one-session exam based on the whole term. It will be given on the last day of
classes, Wednesday, <b>May 21, 08:00 am - 09:40 am</b>. 
It is the responsibility of each student to be available at the time of the examination. 
You <b>must</b> take the final exam in order to pass the course.
		<br><br>
   <b>In-class quizzes and class participation (10%):</b><br>
      The quiz will be given in the first 10 - 15 mins of each week when it is not a test or exam day. 
		The grade will be evenly distributed over all the quizzes. 
		There will be <b>no make-up quiz</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing quiz will be counted as <b>zero</b>.
		<b>No extra time</b> will be given in quizzes to students who arrive late.
		Class participation includes class discussion and the classwork. 
		The purpose of these discussions is to gain practice at analyzing problems 
		and communicating effectively. 
		You will get a classwork sheet in each class and you will finish the sheet 
		in the class.

          <br>
