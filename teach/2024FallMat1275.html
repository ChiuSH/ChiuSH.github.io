	MAT 1275 Workbook by Holly Carley and Ariane Masuda</a><br>
<br>
<b>Course Description:</b> MAT1275 is an intermediate and advanced algebra course which builds a bridge 
		  to connect the knowledge of Math from high school level to college level. 
This is your first college Math class and it will help you to not only get the rhythm of learning 
		  in higher education but also get ready for the future classes.
There are two parts of MAT1275: Expressions and Equations. Topics include quadratic equations, 
		  systems of linear equations, exponential and logarithmic functions; topics from trigonometry, 
		  including identities, equations and solutions of triangles.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Completion of a high school math course of at least Algebra 1 with a score of at least 70 
		  OR NYS Regents Algebra 1 score of at least 75 OR NYS Regents Geometry score of at least 70 
		  OR permission from the Mathematics Department.<br>
<br>
<details>
   <summary>		  
<b>Evaluation:</b> Your final grade will be calculated as:<br>
Three in-class tests (50% total) + one in-class Final Exam (25%)+ in-class quizzes (15%)+ class attendance/participation (10%).
   </summary>
	<p><b>Three in-class tests (50%):</b><br>
There will be three exams. If you miss a test for a verifiable reason (for example, illness or family
emergency), you must notify me as soon as possible and provide a written verification from an appropriate 
authority (not a family member), otherwise you will score 0 for that test. 
Personal travel is not a valid excuse. Your lowest test grade will NOT be dropped, 
		but it will only count for 10% while the other two grades will count for a total of 40% of your final grade.
You are expected to take all tests. There will be <b>no make-up test</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing test will be counted as <b>zero</b>. <b>No extra time</b> will be given in tests to students who arrive late.
          <br><br>
    <b>One in-classFinal Exam (25%):</b><br>
The final exam will be a one-session exam based on the whole term. It will be given on the last day of
classes, Thursday, <b>December 19, 10:00 am - 11:40 am</b>. 
It is the responsibility of each student to be available at the time of the examination. 
You <b>must</b> take the final exam in order to pass the course.
		<br><br>
   <b>In-class quizzes (15%):</b><br>
      The quiz will be given in the first 10 - 15 mins of each lecture when it is not a test or exam day. 
		The grade will be evenly distributed over all the quizzes. 
		There will be <b>no make-up quiz</b> under any circumstance. 
		Any missing quiz will be counted as <b>zero</b>.
		<b>No extra time</b> will be given in quizzes to students who arrive late.
		<br><br>
  <b>Class attendance/participation (10%):</b><br>	
    	Class attendance/participation will count for 10% of the final grade. The purpose of these discussions
is to gain practice at analyzing problems and communicating effectively. 
		You will get a classwork sheet in each class and you will finish the sheet 
		and <b>turn in the sheet</b> to the instructor at the end of class.
